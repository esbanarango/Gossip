##Description

This is _simple_ web chat application which we wanted to made as nice as we could. The basic idea behind scenes is a real-time ( publish and subscribe) application where you will be able to use from a web browser as well as from a desktop program.

##Requirements
This app was entirely made using Ruby (_1.9.>_) and Ruby on Rails, so you must have installed Ruby and Rails in your machine. Please go to these sites, there you'll find a nice guides to install both.

>We recommend to run it on Linux or Mac OS. Rails run extremely slow on Windows (Actually we should say that _Windows runs Rails extremely slow_:P).

##Setup

The app needs to run two servers. 
First, make sure you run `$ bundle install` to install all the dependencies. Then, setup the database running `$ rake db:migrate` and  fill it up running `$ rake db:seed`.

Now you'll be able to run `$ rails s`, to start the rails server, and  now you can start up that Rack server by running `$ rackup private_pub.ru -s thin -E production`.

#####Linux Note.
If you're on Linux, there is a _problem_ with the ports when you start up the Rack server, so you'll have to change the _private_pub.yml_ file. on:

```yaml
development:
  server: "http://localhost:9292/faye"
  secret_token: "secret"
```
Change the port `9292` to `8000` (or whatever you want.), and then start up the Rack server with `$ rackup private_pub.ru -s thin -p 8000 -E production`. (You'll also need to restar the Rails sever in order to get the changes made on _private_pub.yml_)

####Web
Now you can go to `http://localhost:3000` and enjoy it :).

####Desktop
Being on the _Gossip Thick_ folder (`$ cd Gossip\ Thick/`), run `$ ruby GossipServer.rb ` and you can enjoy it too from you favorite console :).
